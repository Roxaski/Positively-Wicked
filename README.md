This theme was created for use in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) alot of effort was put into this theme, ensuring that not only it's visually pleasing to the eye, but also ensuring that it's easy on the eyes for prolonged sessions. If anyone wants to create an PR's to make any additions or changes, your more than welcome to do so.

There's both light and dark variants to this theme, both of them are based on the two main characters which were used as a huge inspiration when creating these themes. Glinda's light theme, is very focused on different shades of pink along with purple accents, in contrast Elphaba's dark theme is black with a range of different shades of green.
